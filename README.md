[Basys3](https://reference.digilentinc.com/programmable-logic/basys-3/start) is a FPGA development kit, with a Artix - 7 FPGA.
<br>The Basys 3 board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform based on the latest Artix-7â„¢ Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx.

  We can see the basic image of the Basys3 FPGA and all the options available on a board.

  So the Basys board can be communicated through 3 different modes, namely
  
  1.  JTAG - JTAG is a common hardware interface that provides your computer with a way to communicate directly with the chips on a board.
  2.  Quad SPI Flash Quad SPI is similar to dual, but improves the throughput four times. Two additional data lines are added, and there are 4 bits transferred every clock cycle.
  3.  USB Flash Drive.
